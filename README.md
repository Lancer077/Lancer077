## Hello There 👋

My name is Mason and I am student at Illinois State University.

I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science alongside a Business Administration Minor.

I am very familiar with Python, Java, C++, SQL, and Arduino.
I am decent at GO, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I have done plenty of projects in the past, many of which have since been lost to time but to name a few, I have done
- A python program that when given the lengths of sides in a 4 sided polygon, computes the angles necessary for the polygon to exist
- During Covid in High School, I made a python program that would automatically bring up whatever class I had next, which helped me from getting carried away with coding during my lunch hour
- Using pyautogui and some other python libraries to make a "captcha solver" for determining whether an image is a bike or not
- In a college database class, we designed and then used SQL to implement a database for a car repair shop
- A DIY guitar hero controller

But some of my most favorite projects were from my time spent working as a part of the ISU Solar Car Racing Team as a member of the electrical/coding team.
It was here that I developed skills for working with embedded software and really learned to enjoy working with it.
I ended up coding all the screens for the driver as well as all of the functionality between the driver and the motor controller.
In doing so, I learned a lot about CANbus, which is the industry standard for how microcontrollers send/receive data in a car.

Something I have learned through lots of coding classes is that rarely does anyone get it right on their first try. It is only through experiementation and evolution that one can write truly good code. 

I also tend to have a habit to work in smaller file sizes so that I can do Ctrl+a and backspace. My general approach is that my first attempt at a project will lead to problems down the line, so I take my first attempt at coding as nothing less than a learning opportunity for what I want to end up doing in future iterations.

For now, I am going to keep working through leetcode problems that I find interesting and putting my solutions here, as a sort of sample for any potential employers.

I am actively looking for a job in any field related to software development, project management, embedded software, or pretty much anything that involves solving problems through code.
