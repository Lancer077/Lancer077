## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mason and I am student at Illinois State University.

I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science alongside a Business Administration Minor.

I am very familiar with Python, Java, C++, SQL, and Arduino.
I am decent at GO, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I have done plenty of projects in the past, many of which have since been lost to time but to name a few, I have done
- A python program that when given the lengths of sides in a 4 sided polygon, computes the angles necessary for the polygon to exist
- During Covid in High School, I made a python program that would automatically bring up whatever class I had next, which helped me from getting carried away with coding during my lunch hour
- Using pyautogui and some other python libraries to make a "captcha solver" for determining whether an image is a bike or not
- In a college database class, we designed and then used SQL to implement a database for a car repair shop
- A DIY guitar hero controller

But some of my most favorite projects were from my time spent working as a part of the ISU Solar Car Racing Team as a member of the electrical/coding team.
It was here that I developed skills for working with embedded software and really learned to enjoy working with it.
I ended up coding all the screens for the driver as well as all of the functionality between the driver and the motor controller.
In doing so, I learned a lot about CANbus, which is the industry standard for how microcontrollers send/receive data in a car.

For now, I am going to keep working through leetcode problems that I find interesting and putting my solutions here, as a sort of sample for any potential employers.

I am actively looking for a job in any field related to software development, project management, embedded software, or pretty much anything that involves solving problems through code.
